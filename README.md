# To Do List API

A Restfull API that works storing task lists to system users.


## Instructions
To run the API you need to do the following steps:
- Install [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html) in your computer;
- Open Xampp Service Manager and run Apache and MySQL services;
- Paste the project repository in `C://xampp/htdocs` if you use Windows in `/opt/lampp/htdocs/` if you use Linux;
- Making it, the API will run on `http://localhost/todo-list-api/todo.php`;
- The script to create the project database you will find in `./database/create_db.sql`;
- Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in your browser and create a database called `todo_list_proj`;
- Run the script to create the tables and a initial user to store tasks;
- With all this ready, you'll be able to use this API.
