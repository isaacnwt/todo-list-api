# To Do List API

A restfull api that works storing task lists to system users.


## Note
To run the API you need to do the following steps:
- Install [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html) in your computer;
- Open Xampp Service Manager and run Apache and MySQL services;
- Paste the project repository on htdocs, inside xampp folder (or lampp if you use linux). Making it, the API will run on `http://localhost/todo-list-api/todo.php`;
- The script to create the project db you will find on `database/create_db.sql`;
- Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in your browser and create a database called `todo_list_proj`, run the script to create the tables and a initial user to store tasks;
- With all this ready, you'll be able to use this API.
